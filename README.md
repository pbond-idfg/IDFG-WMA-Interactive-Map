IDFG-WMA-Interactive-Map
========================

Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Management Area Interactive Map

This map was created through a combination of ArcGIS Online, ArcServer, and an Esri story map template.

The intital story map application template was downloaded from:
http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=36818676b74b453facef972ee5d90114

It was further customized to give it the IDFG look and feel and to other more functionality, such as the basemap picker.
