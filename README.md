IDFG-WMA-Interactive-Map
========================

Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Management Area Interactive Map.  
Thirty-two Wildlife Management Areas located in seven Fish and Game regions have been established to protect wildlife habitat and are available for hunting, fishing and other public enjoyment of wildlife. 
Varying from 275 to 85,000 acres, each area is dedicated to primary purposes such as big game, waterfowl and upland game.

This map was created through a combination of ArcGIS Online, ArcServer, and an Esri story map template.

The intital story map application template was downloaded from:
http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=36818676b74b453facef972ee5d90114

It was further customized to give it the IDFG look and feel and to add more functionality, such as the basemap picker.

This interactive map has been "retired" and replaced with a new, responsive version.
